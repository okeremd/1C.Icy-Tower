Description of the Icy Tower
=============================
Icy tower is a single player action and platform game which user controls the character for jumping on platforms quickly. Player's purpose is, not to fall behind the speed of the ascending system for a certain time. This causes the character to be placed to the outside of the screen which ends the game.

The gamespace is a vertical area which continuously moving up and contains platforms. The character can jump on those platforms to move up. The platforms will have different types of instances such as thin, hardly visible, slippery.

The player can control the character for moving left and right, and jumping with the keys he/she choose (left arrow, right arrow and space bar by default). 

The player will have a score that depends on the altitude and level. There will be 3 levels (easy, medium, hard) that affects the speed of moving up of the system.
